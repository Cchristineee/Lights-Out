# Lights Out 
A kotlin program based on the electronic game of the same name released by Tiger Electronics in 1995. The purpose of the game is to turn all the lights out 
(turn all the squares black) by tapping in the squares. Each tap turns on or off the lights in the square tapped and orthogonally adjacent squares. 
The New Game button randomly resets each square to on or off and the help button will teach you how the game is played. 
You have 4 colors to chose from; red, yellow, orange and green.
